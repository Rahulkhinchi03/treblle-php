Treblle makes it super easy to understand whatâ€™s going on with your APIs and the apps that use them. Just by adding Treblle to your API out of the box you get:
* Real-time API monitoring and logging
* Auto-generated API docs with OAS support
* API analytics
* Quality scoring
* One-click testing
* API management on the go
* and more...

## Requirements
* PHP 5.5+

## Dependencies
* [`guzzlehttp/guzzle`](https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/guzzle)

## Installation
You can install Treblle for PHP via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Simply run the following command:
```bash
$ composer require treblle/treblle-php
```

## Getting started
Next, create a FREE account on <https://treblle.com> to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your API code like so:

```php
<?php
// DON'T FORGET TO AUTOLOAD COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES
require_once("vendor/autoload.php");

// INITIALIZE TREBLLE
$treblle = new Treblle\Treblle('_YOUR_API_KEY_', '_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_');
```
That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding that line of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

## Configuration options
Treblle **masks sensitive information** from the request parameters **before it even leaves your server**. The following parameters are automatically masked: password, pwd, secret, password_confirmation, cc, card_number, ccv, ssn, credit_score. You can extend this list by providing your own custom keywords by doing the following:

```php
<?php
// DON'T FORGET TO AUTOLOAD COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES
require_once("vendor/autoload.php");

/*
* Pass an array of words that you would like to be masked
* as a third parameter when initializing Treblle
*/
$treblle = new Treblle\Treblle(
	'_YOUR_API_KEY_', 
	'_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_', 
	['keyword', 'maskme', 'sensitive']
);
```
